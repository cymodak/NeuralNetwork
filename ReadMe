Steps to run code:

1) Ensure the datasets and codes (all .m files) are in the same folder.
2) Execute main.m
3) Adjustable parameters are given under the heading "Tunable parameters" on line 21 of main.m
4) The input for hidden layers should be given as [x y] to initialize two layers containing x and y units respectively
5) The default settings are: Momentum = 0, Learning rate = 0.1, Regularization = 0, Dropout = 0, epochs = 25, Architecture: 1 hidden layer with 100 units
